The two institutions have now agreed to jointly test the potential of Wikibase, the software used to run the free database Wikidata, for use in the largest authority file for cultural data in German-speaking countries, the Integrated Authority File (Gemeinsame Normdatei, GND). The significance of the evaluation project for the world of open data, the GLAM area and libraries, in particular, is described here., the software used to run the free database Wikidata, for use in the largest authority file for cultural data in German-speaking countries, the Integrated Authority File (Gemeinsame Normdatei, GND).

### Lingua Libre

[Lingua Libre](https://lingualibre.fr/wiki/LinguaLibre:Main_Page) is a library of audio records that everyone can complete by giving a few words, some proverbs, a few sentences, and so on. Lingua Libre has been designed so that everyone can pass on to future generations the fragile treasure of orality.
The words, phrases, expressions thus collected thanks to you will improve some Wikimedia projects (like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and the Wiktionary) and help specialists in their work.


## Museums

### Botanical Garden & Bontanical Museum Berlin

[Botanical Garden & Botanical Museum Berlin](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/botanic-garden-and-botanical-museum) is using Wikibase as plattform to develop a semantic biodiversity standard.

## Science 

### Factgrid

[FactGrid](https://blog.factgrid.de/) is a Wikibase installation run by the Gotha Research Centre and hosted at the University of Erfurt. Using Wikimedia’s groundbreaking software — the software that is centrally used by Wikidata — we are trying to provide database services for historical research on a larger collaborative platform. FactGrid used QuickStatements for their Data Import. [Read about their experience](https://blog.factgrid.de/archives/811).
